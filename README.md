# Horiseon Webpage Challenge 1

## Challenge Goals

This challenge illustrates the importance of semantic HTML, a logical code structure, and accessibility. 

In this challenge, a marketing agency provides code that needs to be modified so the codebase follows accessibility standards and is optimized for search engines. The code is redundant and also lacks semantic HTML elements and accessible alt attributes.


## Tools Used

* VSS
* Git
* Git
* Hub
* Dev Tools


## Repairs and Modifications

* Repaired broken links
* Removed redundancies in CSS code
* Added helpful comments to CSS and HTML files
* Added a unique title
* Site now meets accessibility standards
* Code contains semantic HTML elements
* Title is unique and descriptive


## CSS Organization

The CSS mirrors the visual format of the page, from top to bottom, starting with the header and ending with the footer. The comments specify each section of the webpage, which helps eleminate redundancies.


## What I Learned

I learned how to utilize and navigate fundamental coding tools such as VSS, Git and Git Hub.  I also learned how to discuss and develop solutions with fellow coders.
